This library provides a PHP proxy client for the FamilySearch API which anyone may use to interface with the FamilySearch API. This proxy class will return the raw XML result from the FamilySearch API.

This code also provides a library for parsing and working with the data returned from the FamilySearch API.  The FamilySearch API returns data in an XML format. This library parses that XML into an object model which client code can work with to display and manipulate the data.  This library can also be used to convert the parsed data into a GEDCOM format.

This library may also be used to integrate the same client with a PhpGedView site.

This code was created by students from Neumont University. Neumont University is a revolutionary school which provides a hands-on, project-based environment for teaching computer science students.  In addition to classes in computer science theory, the students work on real projects such as this one which truly prepare them to enter the work force.

Access to the web service API requires agreements to be signed. Developers may obtain access to the "ref" system which provides a limited data set and exists solely for development purposes. Please see http://devnet.familysearch.org for more details.
